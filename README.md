# docker-project

**With Multistage Build:**

With multistage builds, you organize your Dockerfile into multiple stages, each with a specific purpose.

**Advantages:**

**Reduced Image Size:** The final image only includes the essential components needed to run the application, omitting unnecessary build artifacts and tools.

**Improved Security:** By separating the build and runtime environments, you minimize the attack surface of the final image
