# With Multi-Stage Build: 
 Built a super-efficient Docker image using multi-stage build for our app! Separate build and runtime stages mean smaller, more secure images. Build tools are used only during build (stage 1), and the final image (stage 2) only carries what's needed to run the app. Faster builds, smaller images, and enhanced security!Experimented with multi-stage builds, and the impact is remarkable! The image size significantly decreased, reaching just 1.83 MB. That's more than a 99% reduction!
